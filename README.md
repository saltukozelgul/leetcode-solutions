# Leetcode Solutions
I created this repository to keep track of my solutions to Leetcode problems. I will be updating this repository as I solve more problems. I will also be adding the links to the problems in the table of contents. I will be using mostly Python to solve the problems because it's more understandable and readable than other languages.

I'm planning to add video explanations to the problems as well.
